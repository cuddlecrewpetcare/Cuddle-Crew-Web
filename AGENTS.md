# Cuddle Crew Pet Care — Codex Repository Instructions

## Business Reference Authority

Before modifying any website copy, service descriptions, pricing logic, estimate logic, booking logic, eligibility logic, policy language, FAQ content, service-area behavior, holiday behavior, payment behavior, safety messaging, onboarding flow, or Precise Petcare handoff behavior, review the relevant files in:

docs/business-reference/

These files are the authoritative business-reference source for Cuddle Crew Pet Care once they are populated and marked CURRENT / APPROVED.

Existing website code, copy, comments, tests, configuration, or previous Codex-generated implementation is not authoritative when it conflicts with a current approved business-reference document.

## Document Status

Business-reference files may use statuses including:

- PLACEHOLDER
- DRAFT
- CURRENT / APPROVED
- SUPERSEDED

Only CURRENT / APPROVED content may be treated as authoritative business policy. PLACEHOLDER and DRAFT content must not be implemented as though approved. SUPERSEDED content must not be used for current website behavior.

## Source Hierarchy

When sources differ, use this hierarchy:

1. Current approved client-facing agreements and policies in docs/business-reference/core/ control the client-facing contractual subjects they address.
2. Current approved internal business rules and review logic in docs/business-reference/logic/ control internal decision logic, review triggers, suitability, booking eligibility, and when automated website behavior must stop for human review.
3. Current approved operating and governance references in docs/business-reference/operations/.
4. Current approved internal guidance in docs/business-reference/guidance/.
5. Precise Petcare is the operational source of truth for individual client records, current bookings, pet profiles, care instructions, access details, schedules, and client-specific approved service plans.
6. Existing website implementation is subordinate to current approved business-reference documents.
7. If two current approved sources materially conflict, STOP and report the conflict for human review. Do not silently choose one.

## Required Codex Behavior

For any task that may affect business behavior:

1. Identify and read the relevant business-reference documents before changing implementation or public copy.
2. Check their Status and use only CURRENT / APPROVED content as authoritative.
3. Compare approved references against the existing website; flag conflicts, missing rules, or ambiguity instead of inventing an answer.
4. Implement only what is supported by approved references and the user's current instruction, preserving unrelated functionality.
5. At completion, state which business-reference documents were used.

Do not rely solely on memory of previous Codex tasks when current repository references are available.

## Explicit User Changes

If the user's current instruction intentionally changes an approved business rule, follow it, identify the authoritative reference files that need updating, and do not leave the repository silently inconsistent. Do not assume a temporary implementation change permanently replaces an approved policy unless the user says so.

## Placeholder Rule

Any file marked `Status: PLACEHOLDER` is NOT authoritative. Codex must not derive business logic from a TODO, filename, placeholder description, examples, or industry-standard pet-sitting assumptions. Wait for authoritative content to be added.

## Internal Logic Privacy

Internal-reference documents may control website behavior without being shown publicly. Do not expose internal risk scores, acceptance thresholds, decline criteria, capacity calculations, private route assumptions or service-area reference points, sensitive insurance limitations, internal decision-making rubrics, or security procedures unless explicitly approved.

When an internal rule requires human review, prefer client-facing wording such as “Personalized review required” rather than revealing the threshold or reasoning.

## Pricing and Estimate Rules

Never hardcode a rate, fee, modifier, surcharge, cancellation threshold, payment deadline, holiday period, travel fee, or review threshold solely from existing website code if a CURRENT / APPROVED business-reference document governs it.

The website estimate builder provides an estimate only; does not guarantee acceptance; does not override a Precise Petcare quote, invoice, or confirmed booking; and must stop automatic calculation where approved review logic requires personalized review. A mathematically calculable price does not mean a booking must be accepted.

## Safety and Scope

No website feature or public copy may imply that payment guarantees acceptance; paying more makes an unsafe, uninsured, or out-of-scope service acceptable; Cuddle Crew provides services outside approved training, insurance, legal, or service scope; Overnight Care means 24-hour continuous presence; routine service windows are exact-time guarantees unless specifically approved; or automated tools override animal welfare or safety review.

## Data and Privacy

Never expose through public frontend code private home addresses, service-area origin/reference points, API keys, client information, access credentials, alarm codes, real-client key identifiers, travel dates, private medical information, veterinary payment information, or identifying incident records. Keep future private routing data server-side; never put secrets in client-side environment variables or committed public code.

## Implementation Architecture

Prefer centralized configuration or data sources over duplicating rules across unrelated components. Keep public display logic separate from private internal review logic where appropriate, and preserve the boundary between website estimates and final Precise Petcare booking/invoice data.

## Public Claims

Never make a public claim about credentials, certifications, insurance, memberships, service area, transportation availability, medical-care capabilities, safety procedures, or other regulated/professional matters unless a CURRENT / APPROVED business-reference source supports it.
